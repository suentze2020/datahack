# datahack
This repository contains learning materials and examples for complementing a series of workshops organised prior to a data hackathon event. Participants for this event can use the materials in conjunction with a self-paced web learning video series: <a href="https://hkdesign.org/courses-page/tools-for-strengthening-your-data-literacy">Tools for Strengthening Your Data Literacy</a> to join the hackathon.
